This project was started in my senior year in high school, restarted and finished in the summer of my first year. This project was first created out of passion for the lord of the rings, but was finish with the intent to demonstrate my skills in creating expansive GUIs. The entire project is done on Python, and the main library used in this project is tkinter.
